# WIP.release

You ship a fix. Now you have to bump package.json, update CHANGELOG.md, sync the version in SKILL.md, commit, tag, push, publish to npm, publish to GitHub Packages, and create a GitHub release. Every time. Miss a step and versions drift.

`wip-release` does all of it in one command. It also checks that product docs (dev update, roadmap, readme-first) are up to date before publishing. Patches get a warning. Minor and major releases are blocked until docs are updated.

## Install

Open your AI coding tool and say:

```
Read the REFERENCE.md and SKILL.md at github.com/wipcomputer/wip-release.
Then explain to me:
1. What is this tool?
2. What does it do?
3. What would it change or fix in our current release process?

Then ask me:
- Do you have more questions?
- Do you want to integrate it into our system?
- Do you want to clone it (use as-is) or fork it (so you can contribute back if you find bugs)?
```

Your agent will read the repo, explain the tool, and walk you through integration interactively.

Also see **[wip-file-guard](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-file-guard)** ... the lock for the repo. Blocks AI agents from overwriting your critical files.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for full usage, pipeline steps, flags, auth, and module API.
