# WIP DevOps Toolbox

Your AI writes code. But does it know how to release it? Check license compliance? Protect your identity files? Sync private repos to public? Follow a real development process?

DevOps Toolbox is the complete toolkit. Built by a team of humans and AIs shipping real software together.

## Tool Details

### wip-universal-installer
One command installs everything a repo ships. CLI binaries, MCP servers, plugins, hooks. Detects what a repo supports and deploys it all. Toolbox mode walks every sub-tool automatically.

Install: `npm install -g @wipcomputer/universal-installer`
Usage: `wip-install wipcomputer/wip-devops-toolbox`
Docs: [README](tools/wip-universal-installer/README.md) | [SPEC](tools/wip-universal-installer/SPEC.md)

### wip-release
One-command release pipeline. Bumps version, updates changelog + SKILL.md, publishes to npm + GitHub Packages, creates GitHub release.

Install: `npm install -g @wipcomputer/wip-release`
Usage: `wip-release patch --notes="description"`
Docs: [README](tools/wip-release/README.md) | [REFERENCE](tools/wip-release/REFERENCE.md)

### wip-license-hook
License rug-pull detection. Scans dependencies and forks for license changes. Git hooks block bad merges. Daily cron scan. Generates compliance dashboard.

Install: `npm install -g @wipcomputer/wip-license-hook`
Usage: `wip-license-hook scan`
Docs: [README](tools/wip-license-hook/README.md)

### wip-license-guard
Copyright and license enforcement for your own repos. Interactive first-run setup asks what licensing you want. Subsequent runs audit and enforce. Toolbox-aware: checks every sub-tool. Auto-fix mode repairs issues.

Usage: `wip-license-guard check` or `wip-license-guard check --fix`
Setup: `wip-license-guard init`
Docs: [cli.mjs](tools/wip-license-guard/cli.mjs)

### wip-repo-permissions-hook
Repo visibility guard. Blocks repos from going public without a `-private` counterpart. Catches accidental exposure of internal plans, todos, and development context.

Usage: `wip-repo-permissions check <org/repo>` or `wip-repo-permissions audit <org>`
Docs: [README](tools/wip-repo-permissions-hook/README.md)

### wip-file-guard
Identity file protection. Blocks destructive edits to CLAUDE.md, SHARED-CONTEXT.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md. Your AI can read them but can't blow them away.

Usage: `wip-file-guard --list`
Docs: [README](tools/wip-file-guard/README.md)

### wip-repos
Repo manifest reconciler. Makes `repos-manifest.json` the single source of truth. Like prettier for folder structure. Move folders around all day; on sync, everything snaps back.

Install: `npm install -g @wipcomputer/wip-repos`
Usage: `wip-repos check` or `wip-repos sync --dry-run`
Docs: [README](tools/wip-repos/README.md)

### deploy-public
Private-to-public repo sync. Excludes `ai/` folder automatically. Creates PR, merges it, syncs release notes, cleans up branches.

Usage: `bash tools/deploy-public/deploy-public.sh <private-repo-path> <public-github-repo>`
Docs: [SKILL](tools/deploy-public/SKILL.md)

### post-merge-rename
Post-merge branch renaming. Scans for merged branches, appends `--merged-YYYY-MM-DD`. Preserves history without cluttering your branch list.

Usage: `bash tools/post-merge-rename/post-merge-rename.sh` or `--dry-run`
Docs: [SKILL](tools/post-merge-rename/SKILL.md)

### LDM Dev Tools.app
macOS automation wrapper. A native .app bundle that runs scheduled jobs (backup, branch protection audit, visibility audit) with Full Disk Access.

Usage: `open -W ~/Applications/LDMDevTools.app --args backup`
Docs: [README](tools/ldm-jobs/README.md)

### Dev Guide
Best practices for AI-assisted development teams. Covers release process, repo structure, branch protection, the `ai/` folder convention, private/public patterns, and more.

Read: [DEV-GUIDE.md](DEV-GUIDE-GENERAL-PUBLIC.md)

## MCP Servers

Core tools are agent-callable via MCP. Add to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "wip-release": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/tools/wip-release/mcp-server.mjs"]
  },
  "wip-license-hook": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/tools/wip-license-hook/mcp-server.mjs"]
  },
  "wip-repo-permissions": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/tools/wip-repo-permissions-hook/mcp-server.mjs"]
  },
  "wip-repos": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/tools/wip-repos/mcp-server.mjs"]
  }
}
```

MCP tools available: `release`, `release_status`, `license_scan`, `license_audit`, `license_gate`, `license_ledger`, `repo_permissions_check`, `repo_permissions_audit`, `repos_check`, `repos_sync_plan`, `repos_add`, `repos_move`, `repos_tree`

## Setup

Install all tools with one command:
```bash
wip-install wipcomputer/wip-devops-toolbox
```

Or install individually:
```bash
npm install -g @wipcomputer/wip-release @wipcomputer/wip-license-hook @wipcomputer/universal-installer @wipcomputer/wip-repos
```
