# WIP AI DevOps Toolbox

Your AI writes code. But does it know how to release it? Check license compliance? Protect your identity files? Sync private repos to public? Follow a real development process?

AI DevOps Toolbox is 13 tools that teach your AI how to do all of this. Once installed, you don't run them manually. Your AI knows how to use them and does it automatically. Built by a team of humans and AIs shipping real software together.

## Platform Compatibility

The tools in this toolbox use different capabilities. Check what you have and tell the user honestly what you can and cannot do.

**What each interface requires:**

| Interface | Requires | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| CLI | Shell access (run bash/node commands) | `wip-release patch`, `wip-install` |
| Module | Node.js import support | `import { release } from 'wip-release'` |
| MCP | MCP client support | `release`, `license_scan`, `repos_check` |
| OC Plugin | OpenClaw agent runtime | Plugin in `~/.openclaw/extensions/` |
| Skill | SKILL.md file (works in both CC and OpenClaw) | You're reading it right now |
| CC Hook | Claude Code CLI with hooks support | PreToolUse hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` |

**Built and tested on:**
- **Claude Code CLI** ... full support (shell, MCP, CC Hooks)
- **OpenClaw** ... full support (shell, MCP, Plugins)

**How to assess your own platform:** Check which capabilities you have (shell access, MCP, hooks) and match them to the table above. If you can run shell commands, CLI tools work. If you can connect to MCP servers, MCP tools work. If you have neither, you can still read and explain the tools, but tell the user which commands to run themselves. Do not claim you can run commands you cannot execute.

## Operating Rules

**Always dry-run first.** Before installing, deploying, or running any destructive operation, run with `--dry-run` so the user can see exactly what will change. Only proceed with the real operation when the user explicitly says to.

**Write dev updates as you work.** When doing significant work on a repo that uses this toolbox, write a dev update to `ai/dev-updates/YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM--agent--description.md`. The release pipeline auto-detects these and uses them as release notes. No more thin one-liners.

## Install

**You are an AI agent helping a user install AI DevOps Toolbox. Walk them through the process step by step. Ask questions, explain what you're doing, and let them make choices.**

### Step 0: Check for LDM OS

LDM OS is the shared infrastructure that manages tool installation across all your AIs. Check if it's installed:

```bash
ldm --version
```

**If installed:** Tell the user their LDM OS version and skip to Step 1.

**If not installed:**

> "AI DevOps Toolbox uses LDM OS to manage installation. LDM OS is the shared infrastructure layer that lets all your AIs share tools, memory, and identity. It's a one-time setup. Want me to install it?"

When the user approves:

```bash
npm install -g @wipcomputer/wip-ldm-os
ldm init
```

If `npm` is not available, check if the user has Node.js installed (`node --version`). They need Node.js 18+. If not installed, tell them to install it from https://nodejs.org first.

### Transparency: Tell the user what's about to happen

Before installing, explain exactly what will change:

> "Here's what AI DevOps Toolbox will set up on your system:
>
> - **CLI tools** on your PATH: wip-release, wip-repos, wip-file-guard, wip-license-hook, wip-license-guard, wip-repo-init, wip-readme-format, deploy-public, post-merge-rename, wip-branch-guard
> - **MCP servers** registered with Claude Code: release, license scanning, repo permissions, repo manifest
> - **Claude Code hooks**: identity file protection (blocks overwrites of CLAUDE.md, SOUL.md), repo visibility guard, branch guard (blocks writes on main)
> - **OpenClaw plugins** (if OpenClaw is detected): file-guard, license-hook, repo-permissions
> - **Extension registry** updated at ~/.ldm/extensions/registry.json
>
> Nothing touches your data. Code gets installed. Your files stay yours.
>
> Want to see a dry run first?"

### Step 1: Dry Run

Always dry-run first:

```bash
ldm install wipcomputer/wip-ai-devops-toolbox --dry-run
```

Show the user the output. It lists every sub-tool and every interface that will be deployed. Walk through what each tool does:

- **wip-release** ... one-command releases (version bump, changelog, npm publish, GitHub release)
- **wip-license-hook** ... catches license changes in dependencies before they ship
- **wip-license-guard** ... enforces your own repo's copyright, LICENSE file, CLA
- **wip-file-guard** ... blocks destructive edits to identity files (CLAUDE.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md)
- **wip-repo-permissions-hook** ... blocks repos from going public without a -private counterpart
- **wip-repos** ... one source of truth for repo folder structure
- **wip-repo-init** ... scaffolds the standard ai/ directory in any repo
- **wip-readme-format** ... generates READMEs following a standard format
- **wip-branch-guard** ... blocks all writes on main branch (forces worktrees/branches)
- **deploy-public** ... syncs private repos to public mirrors
- **post-merge-rename** ... renames merged branches with dates for cleanup
- **universal-installer** ... detects and deploys tool interfaces

Ask: "Do you have questions about any of these? Want to proceed with the install?"

### Step 2: Install

When the user says to proceed:

```bash
ldm install wipcomputer/wip-ai-devops-toolbox
```

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
ldm doctor
```

This checks: all extensions deployed, hooks configured, MCP servers registered, CLI binaries on PATH.

Then test one tool:

```bash
wip-release --version
```

Tell the user: "AI DevOps Toolbox is installed. Your AI now knows how to release software, check license compliance, protect identity files, guard repo visibility, and manage repo manifests. These tools run automatically ... you don't need to invoke them manually."

### Update

If AI DevOps Toolbox is already installed and a new version is available:

```bash
ldm install wipcomputer/wip-ai-devops-toolbox
ldm doctor
```

Updates deploy new code without touching data or configuration.

## Setup & Onboarding

### Universal Installer (built into LDM OS)

Interface detection and deployment engine. Scans a repo, detects which interfaces it supports (CLI, MCP, OpenClaw Plugin, Skill, CC Hook, Module), and deploys each one to the right location. This is what powers `ldm install`.

**How it works:**

1. Clones the repo (or reads a local path)
2. Detects which interfaces the repo supports (scans for package.json bin, mcp-server.mjs, openclaw.plugin.json, SKILL.md, guard.mjs)
3. If the repo has a `tools/` directory with sub-tools, it enters toolbox mode and installs each one
4. For each tool, it deploys every detected interface:

| Interface | How it's detected | Where it deploys |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| CLI | `package.json` has `bin` entries | `npm install -g` |
| Module | `package.json` has `main` or `exports` | Importable via `node_modules` |
| MCP Server | Has `mcp-server.mjs` or `mcp-server.js` | `claude mcp add --scope user` |
| OpenClaw Plugin | Has `openclaw.plugin.json` | `~/.ldm/extensions/` and `~/.openclaw/extensions/` |
| Skill | Has `SKILL.md` | `~/.openclaw/skills/<tool>/SKILL.md` |
| CC Hook | Has `guard.mjs` or `claudeCode.hook` in package.json | `~/.claude/settings.json` |

5. Updates the extension registry at `~/.ldm/extensions/registry.json`

**Standalone fallback:** If LDM OS is not installed, the `wip-install` CLI provides the same detection and deployment. It will attempt to install LDM OS automatically, then delegate. If that fails, it falls back to standalone mode.

**Interfaces:** CLI, Module, Skill

### Dev Guide

Your team's conventions, baked in. Best practices for AI-assisted development teams.

**What it covers:**
- Release process (branch, PR, merge, wip-release, deploy-public)
- Repo structure (the `ai/` folder convention, private/public pattern)
- Branch conventions (agent prefixes: `cc-mini/`, `lesa-mini/`, `cc-air/`)
- Branch protection rules
- Multi-agent clone workflow
- License compliance (dual MIT+AGPL, CLA)

**How to use it:** Read [DEV-GUIDE.md](DEV-GUIDE-GENERAL-PUBLIC.md) before doing repo work. It's the reference for how the team operates.

**Interface:** Documentation (no CLI, no MCP)

---

## Infrastructure

### LDM Dev Tools.app

Scheduled automation that runs whether anyone remembers or not. macOS .app bundle with Full Disk Access.

**What it runs:**
- `backup.sh` ... backs up critical files
- `branch-protect.sh` ... audits branch protection rules across all repos
- `visibility-audit.sh` ... checks repo visibility matches the public/private pattern
- `crystal-capture.sh` ... triggers memory crystal capture

**Commands:**
```
open -W ~/Applications/LDMDevTools.app --args backup
open -W ~/Applications/LDMDevTools.app --args branch-protect
open -W ~/Applications/LDMDevTools.app --args visibility-audit
```

Scripts can also run standalone without the .app:
```
bash tools/ldm-jobs/backup.sh
bash tools/ldm-jobs/branch-protect.sh
bash tools/ldm-jobs/visibility-audit.sh
```

**Where it writes:** Depends on the script. Backup writes to the backup target. Audits write to stdout.

**Interface:** Standalone macOS app

---

## Release & Deploy

### wip-release

Release software correctly. Version bump, changelog, npm publish, GitHub release. One command, nothing forgotten.

**Commands:**
```
wip-release patch --notes="description"     # bump patch (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
wip-release minor --notes="description"     # bump minor (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
wip-release major --notes="description"     # bump major (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
wip-release patch --dry-run                 # preview without changes
wip-release patch --no-publish              # bump + tag only, skip npm/GitHub
wip-release patch --notes-file=path         # read notes from a file
wip-release patch                           # auto-detect notes (see below)
```

**Release notes auto-detection (first match wins):**

1. `--notes-file=path` ... explicit file path
2. `RELEASE-NOTES-v{ver}.md` in repo root (e.g. `RELEASE-NOTES-v1-7-4.md`)
3. `ai/dev-updates/YYYY-MM-DD*` ... today's dev update files (most recent first)
4. `--notes="one-liner"` ... used as fallback, but if a dev update exists with more content, the dev update wins

Write dev updates as you work. wip-release picks them up automatically. No more thin release notes.

**What happens when you run `wip-release`:**

1. **Step 0:** License compliance gate. If `.license-guard.json` exists, checks LICENSE file, copyright, CLA.md, README license section. Aborts if any check fails.
2. **Step 1:** Bumps version in `package.json`
3. **Step 2:** Syncs version to `SKILL.md` (if it exists)
4. **Step 3:** Updates `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version entry
5. **Step 4:** Auto-detects release notes from RELEASE-NOTES file, ai/dev-updates/, or --notes flag
6. **Step 5:** Commits the version bump
7. **Step 6:** Creates git tag `v{version}`
8. **Step 7:** Pushes commit and tag to origin
9. **Step 8:** Publishes to npm (if not `private: true`)
10. **Step 9:** Publishes to GitHub Packages
11. **Step 10:** Creates GitHub release with release notes (full narrative, not one-liners)
12. **Step 11:** Publishes SKILL.md to website as plain text (if SKILL.md exists and `WIP_WEBSITE_REPO` is set)
13. **Step 12:** Renames merged branches with `--merged-YYYY-MM-DD`
14. **Step 13:** Prunes old merged branches (keeps last 3 per developer prefix)

**Where it writes:** `package.json`, `SKILL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, git tags, npm registry, GitHub Releases

**Safety:**
- `--dry-run` previews everything without writing
- License gate prevents releasing with broken compliance
- If push fails (branch protection), it tells you to push manually via PR
- npm publish failure (e.g., `private: true`) is non-fatal; release continues

**MCP tools:** `release`, `release_status`

**Interfaces:** CLI, Module, MCP, Skill

### deploy-public

Publish safely. Syncs a private repo to its clean public counterpart.

**Commands:**
```
bash scripts/deploy-public.sh <private-repo-path> <public-github-repo>

# Example:
bash scripts/deploy-public.sh /path/to/memory-crystal-private wipcomputer/memory-crystal
```

**What happens when you run it:**

1. Clones the public repo to `/tmp/`
2. Copies all files from the private repo, excluding `ai/` and `.git/`
3. Creates a branch (`cc-mini/deploy-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
4. Commits with the latest merge commit message from private
5. Pushes the branch, creates a PR, merges it
6. Deletes the deploy branch
7. Creates or updates the GitHub release on the public repo (syncs release notes from private)
8. Checks for and deletes stale branches on the public repo

**Where it writes:** Public GitHub repo (via PR). Local `/tmp/` for the clone (cleaned up).

**Safety:**
- Never pushes directly to main. Always uses a PR.
- The `ai/` folder is automatically excluded. Internal plans, todos, dev context never reach public.
- If the public repo doesn't exist, the script fails (doesn't create repos).

**Interfaces:** CLI, Skill

### post-merge-rename

Cleans up after itself. Renames merged branches so you know what's done.

**Commands:**
```
bash scripts/post-merge-rename.sh              # rename merged branches
bash scripts/post-merge-rename.sh --prune      # rename + delete old ones
bash scripts/post-merge-rename.sh --dry-run    # preview without changes
```

**What happens:**

1. Scans remote branches that are fully merged into main
2. Renames them by appending `--merged-YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `cc-mini/feature` becomes `cc-mini/feature--merged-2026-03-10`)
3. With `--prune`: for each developer prefix (`cc-mini/`, `lesa-mini/`, etc.), keeps the last 3 merged branches and deletes the rest from the remote
4. Also finds stale branches that are fully merged but were never renamed, and deletes them

**Rules:**
- Never deletes `main`
- Never deletes the current working branch
- Always keeps the last 3 per developer prefix

**Where it writes:** Remote branch names on GitHub (renames and deletes)

**Interfaces:** CLI, Skill

### Skill Publish to Website

After every release, your SKILL.md goes live as plain text on your website. No manual copying. No config file needed.

**How it works:** Built into `wip-release`. If SKILL.md exists and `WIP_WEBSITE_REPO` env var is set, the release pipeline automatically copies SKILL.md to `{website}/wip.computer/install/{name}.txt` and runs `deploy.sh` to push it live.

**Name resolution (first match wins):**
1. `.publish-skill.json` in repo root: `{ "name": "my-tool" }`
2. `package.json` name (with `@scope/` prefix stripped)
3. Directory name (with `-private` suffix stripped)

**Setup:**
```bash
export WIP_WEBSITE_REPO="/path/to/your-website-repo"
```

That's it. Every repo with a SKILL.md auto-publishes on release. The convention is `yoursite.com/install/{name}.txt`. Plain text, no HTML. Any AI can `fetch()` the URL and get clean, parseable install instructions.

**Override the name (optional):** Add `.publish-skill.json` to repo root:
```json
{ "name": "memory-crystal" }
```

**Non-blocking:** If the website repo is missing, deploy fails, or the env var isn't set, the release still succeeds. You'll see a warning in the output.

**Interface:** Module (built into Release Pipeline)

---

## License, Compliance, and Protection

### wip-file-guard

Knows what it can never overwrite. Blocks destructive edits to identity files.

**Protected files:** CLAUDE.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, SHARED-CONTEXT.md, IDENTITY.md

**How it works as a CC Hook:**
- Runs as a PreToolUse hook in Claude Code
- Intercepts `Write` and `Edit` tool calls
- If the target file is a protected identity file:
  - `Write` (full overwrite) is **blocked**
  - `Edit` (partial edit) is **allowed** (appending/updating sections is fine)
- Returns JSON: `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` or `{"decision": "allow"}`

**Commands:**
```
wip-file-guard --list                    # list protected files
wip-file-guard --check <filepath>        # check if a file is protected
```

**As a CC Hook (automatic):**
Configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.PreToolUse`. Runs automatically on every Write/Edit call. No manual invocation needed.

**As an OpenClaw Plugin:**
Deployed to `~/.openclaw/extensions/wip-file-guard/`. Blocks destructive edits in the OpenClaw agent pipeline.

**Where it writes:** Nothing. It only reads and blocks.

**Interfaces:** CLI, Module, OpenClaw Plugin, Skill, CC Hook

### wip-license-guard

Enforces licensing on every commit. Copyright, dual-license, CLA. Checked automatically.

**Commands:**
```
wip-license-guard check                  # audit current repo
wip-license-guard check --fix            # audit and auto-fix issues
wip-license-guard init                   # interactive first-run setup
wip-license-guard init --from-standard   # apply WIP Computer defaults without prompting
```

**What it checks:**
- LICENSE file exists and matches configured license type
- Copyright line is correct and current year
- CLA.md exists (if configured)
- README has a `## License` section
- For toolbox repos: checks every sub-tool in `tools/`

**Config:** `.license-guard.json` in repo root. Created by `init`. Contains copyright holder, license type, year, and what to enforce.

**As a wip-release gate:**
Step 0 of wip-release reads `.license-guard.json` and runs the same checks. Aborts the release if compliance fails.

**`--from-standard` generates:**
- `.license-guard.json` with WIP Computer defaults
- `LICENSE` file (dual MIT+AGPL)
- `CLA.md`

**Where it writes:** `.license-guard.json`, `LICENSE`, `CLA.md`, README (with `--fix`)

**Interfaces:** CLI

### wip-license-hook

Catches license changes in dependencies before they ship.

**Commands:**
```
wip-license-hook scan                    # scan all dependencies for license changes
wip-license-hook scan --json             # output as JSON
wip-license-hook audit                   # full compliance audit
wip-license-hook ledger                  # show the license compliance ledger
wip-license-hook gate                    # pass/fail gate for CI or pre-merge
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
2. For each dependency, checks the current license against the last known license in the ledger
3. If a license changed (rug-pull), flags it
4. The ledger (`license-ledger.json`) tracks every dependency's license over time
5. `gate` returns exit code 0 (pass) or 1 (fail) for CI integration

**Git hooks:**
- `pre-push` hook blocks pushes if license changes are detected
- `pre-pull` hook warns on pull if upstream changed licenses

**MCP tools:** `license_scan`, `license_audit`, `license_gate`, `license_ledger`

**Where it writes:** `license-ledger.json` (the compliance record)

**Interfaces:** CLI, Module, MCP, Skill

---

## Repo Management

### wip-repo-permissions-hook

Never accidentally exposes a private repo.

**Commands:**
```
wip-repo-permissions check wipcomputer/memory-crystal    # check one repo
wip-repo-permissions audit wipcomputer                   # audit entire org
```

**What it checks:**
- If a repo is public, does it have a `-private` counterpart?
- If not, it's flagged as exposed (internal content may be visible)

**As a CC Hook (automatic):**
Intercepts commands that could change repo visibility (e.g., `gh repo edit --visibility public`). Blocks if the `-private` counterpart doesn't exist.

**As an OpenClaw Plugin:**
Deployed to `~/.openclaw/extensions/wip-repo-permissions-hook/`. Same check in the agent pipeline.

**MCP tools:** `repo_permissions_check`, `repo_permissions_audit`

**Where it writes:** Nothing. It only reads and blocks.

**Interfaces:** CLI, Module, MCP, OpenClaw Plugin, Skill, CC Hook

### wip-repos

Knows where every repo belongs. One source of truth for folder structure.

**Commands:**
```
wip-repos check                          # compare filesystem to manifest
wip-repos sync --dry-run                 # preview what sync would move
wip-repos sync                           # move repos to match manifest
wip-repos add <org/repo> <category>      # add a repo to the manifest
wip-repos move <org/repo> <new-category> # move a repo in the manifest
wip-repos tree                           # show the manifest as a tree
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `repos-manifest.json` (the single source of truth)
- Compares against the actual filesystem
- `check` reports drift (repos in wrong locations, missing repos, unknown repos)
- `sync` moves repos to match the manifest

**MCP tools:** `repos_check`, `repos_sync_plan`, `repos_add`, `repos_move`, `repos_tree`

**Where it writes:** Moves directories on the filesystem (with `sync`). Updates `repos-manifest.json` (with `add`/`move`).

**Interfaces:** CLI, Module, MCP, Skill

### wip-repo-init

Scaffold the standard `ai/` directory in any repo. One command.

**Commands:**
```
wip-repo-init /path/to/repo              # scaffold ai/ in a repo
wip-repo-init /path/to/repo --dry-run    # preview without changes
wip-repo-init /path/to/repo --yes        # skip confirmation prompt
```

**What happens:**

**New repo (no ai/ folder):** Creates the full standard structure with READMEs explaining what goes where.

**Existing repo (ai/ folder exists):** Shows you what will happen and asks for confirmation:
1. Moves your current `ai/` contents to `ai/_sort/ai_old/`
2. Scaffolds the new standard structure
3. You sort files from `ai_old/` into the new structure at your own pace

Nothing is deleted. Your old files are all in `ai/_sort/ai_old/`.

**The standard structure:**

```
ai/
  read-me-first.md          <- explains everything, links to all sections
  _sort/                    <- holding pen for files that need sorting
  _trash/                   <- archive (never delete, move here)
  dev-updates/              <- engineering changelog, auto-detected by wip-release
  product/
    readme-first-product.md <- the product bible
    notes/                  <- freeform notes, research
    plans-prds/             <- plans with lifecycle stages
      roadmap.md            <- prioritized roadmap
      current/              <- plans being built now
      upcoming/             <- plans that are next
      archive-complete/     <- plans that shipped
      todos/                <- per-agent todo files
    product-ideas/          <- ideas that aren't plans yet
```

Every folder has a `_trash/` subfolder. Every section has a README.

**Where it writes:** Creates directories and files inside `ai/`. If an existing `ai/` is present, moves it to `ai/_sort/ai_old/`.

**Interfaces:** CLI, Skill

### wip-readme-format

Generate or validate READMEs following the WIP Computer standard. One command.

**Commands:**
```
wip-readme-format /path/to/repo              # generate README-init-*.md section files
wip-readme-format /path/to/repo --deploy     # assemble sections into README.md
wip-readme-format /path/to/repo --dry-run    # preview without writing
wip-readme-format /path/to/repo --check      # validate existing README against standard
```

**What happens:**

**Generate mode (default):** Detects interfaces, reads SKILL.md for tool names, generates separate section files:
- `README-init-badges.md` ... org header + interface badges
- `README-init-title.md` ... title + tagline
- `README-init-teach.md` ... "Teach Your AI" onboarding block
- `README-init-features.md` ... features list (preserved from existing README or auto-generated for toolbox repos)
- `README-init-coverage.md` ... interface coverage table (toolbox repos only)
- `README-init-more-info.md` ... links to docs
- `README-init-license.md` ... license block + built-by line
- `README-init-technical.md` ... technical content extracted from old README

**Deploy mode:** Backs up existing README.md and TECHNICAL.md to `ai/_trash/`, assembles section files in order into README.md, moves technical to TECHNICAL.md, deletes the staging files.

Edit any section independently before deploying. Same pattern as release notes: staging, review, deploy.

**Toolbox mode:** For repos with `tools/` subdirectories, aggregates interfaces from all sub-tools for badges, generates an interface coverage table using SKILL.md `name:` frontmatter for human-readable names.

**Where it writes:** README-init-*.md files in the repo root (staging). On deploy: README.md, TECHNICAL.md, and backups to `ai/_trash/`.

**Interfaces:** CLI, Skill

## MCP Server Configuration

Tools with MCP interfaces are agent-callable. Add to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "wip-release": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/tools/wip-release/mcp-server.mjs"]
  },
  "wip-license-hook": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/tools/wip-license-hook/mcp-server.mjs"]
  },
